                  Working remotely is very comfortable, but there is still so much value in in-person collaboration. I loved the experience of working with the team in London, and even if not the most time efficient, stand-ups were the highlight of my days and kept me motivated.

                  I really enjoyed the two days that Ben and I spent diving into every imputation model while in London. I felt so much more comfortable with the results I was producing and started to truly understand the math behind it all.

                  I really appreciated when Max invited me to a meeting with Urban Institute to discuss the Social Genome Project they were working on. I loved seeing how our work interacts with the broader policy and social impact landscape and how we can contribute to it. I learned a lot debriefing about it with him afterwards.

                Well, now I have a lot of developer skills that I never thought I would even seek. I feel closer to what data science is especially in interaction with the social sciences and public policy. I hope to continue working in this field, contributing to open-source projects that have a positive social impact. I must admit I didn't think I would work in econ related topics, but more and more, I find I get really curious and excited about modeling all these complex behaviors.

                In the short term, I plan to keep contributing to microimpute as part of my thesis, focusing on improving its performance and usability. I really hope to get that paper out and contribute to research in the field. If new ideas about data imputation and its applications arise, please reach out! I'd love to hear them and keep them in mind while I work on microimpute.
